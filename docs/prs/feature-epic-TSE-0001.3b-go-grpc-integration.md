# feat(audit-correlator-go): Complete gRPC Integration Infrastructure (TSE-0001.3b)

## Summary

Complete implementation of gRPC integration infrastructure for audit-correlator-go, following the proven patterns established in Python services. This milestone enables the audit correlator to discover and communicate with other services via gRPC, completing TSE-0001.3b for this component.

## What Changed

### audit-correlator-go

**New Infrastructure**:
- Enhanced gRPC server with health service (ports 8083 HTTP, 9093 gRPC)
- Redis-based service discovery with heartbeat mechanism
- Configuration service client with intelligent caching
- Inter-service communication clients (RiskMonitor, TradingEngine)

**Architecture**:
- Clean Architecture with proper layer separation
- Dependency injection with graceful defaults
- Comprehensive error handling and graceful degradation
- Connection pooling and caching for performance

**Testing**:
- 14 tests total (9 unit + 5 integration)
- Service discovery integration tests
- Configuration client tests
- gRPC server lifecycle tests

## Key Features Implemented

### üîó **Enhanced gRPC Server**
- Health service with comprehensive status reporting
- Concurrent HTTP (8083) and gRPC (9093) server operation
- Metrics tracking (connections, requests, uptime)
- Graceful shutdown with proper cleanup

### üîç **Service Discovery Integration**
- Redis-based service registration with TTL management
- Automatic heartbeat mechanism for health maintenance
- Dynamic service lookup with filtering capabilities
- Local IP detection and unique service ID generation

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Configuration Service Client**
- HTTP-based client with intelligent caching (5-minute TTL)
- Comprehensive type conversion (string, int, bool, JSON)
- Cache performance statistics with hit/miss tracking
- Graceful fallback when configuration service unavailable

### üåê **Inter-Service Communication**
- Connection pooling and management for gRPC clients
- Service-specific clients (RiskMonitorClient, TradingEngineClient)
- Circuit breaker pattern with ServiceUnavailableError handling
- Dynamic endpoint resolution via service discovery

## Architecture Highlights

- **Clean Architecture**: Proper separation with infrastructure, presentation, and service layers
- **Dependency Injection**: All components configurable with graceful defaults
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error scenarios with graceful degradation
- **Performance**: Connection pooling, caching, and metrics for production readiness

## Test Coverage

- **Unit Tests**: 9 test cases covering all core functionality
- **Integration Tests**: 5 test cases for end-to-end communication scenarios
- **Smart Skipping**: Tests gracefully skip when external dependencies unavailable
- **Build Verification**: Service compiles and starts correctly

## Validation

```bash
# Run all tests
go test -tags=unit ./internal -v
go test -tags=integration ./internal -v

# Verify build
go build -o audit-correlator ./cmd/server

# Test service startup
timeout 3s ./audit-correlator
```

## Files Changed

### Core Implementation
- `internal/infrastructure/configuration_client.go` - Configuration service client with caching
- `internal/infrastructure/service_discovery.go` - Redis-based service discovery
- `internal/infrastructure/grpc_clients.go` - Inter-service gRPC client manager
- `internal/presentation/grpc/server.go` - Enhanced gRPC server implementation

### Testing & Configuration
- `internal/configuration_client_test.go` - Configuration client test suite
- `internal/service_discovery_test.go` - Service discovery test suite
- `internal/grpc_server_test.go` - gRPC server test suite
- `internal/inter_service_communication_test.go` - Integration test suite

### Project Management
- `go.mod` - Added Redis dependencies for service discovery
- `.gitignore` - Comprehensive Go project exclusions
- `TODO.md` - Updated milestone completion status
- `cmd/server/main.go` - Updated to use new gRPC server implementation

## Pattern Replication Ready

This implementation serves as the **reference pattern** for remaining Go services:
- custodian-simulator-go
- exchange-simulator-go
- market-data-simulator-go

All components follow identical patterns established in Python services, ensuring consistency across the ecosystem.

## Dependencies

- **TSE-0001.1a**: Go Services Bootstrapping ‚úÖ (Complete)
- **TSE-0001.3a**: Core Infrastructure Setup ‚úÖ (Complete)
- **Protobuf Schemas**: Schema service integration ready

## BDD Acceptance Criteria ‚úÖ

**"Go services can discover and communicate with each other via gRPC"**

- ‚úÖ gRPC server with health service operational
- ‚úÖ Service registration and discovery functional
- ‚úÖ Configuration client with caching working
- ‚úÖ Inter-service communication established
- ‚úÖ Error handling and graceful degradation verified

## Milestone Status

- **TSE-0001.3b**: Go Services gRPC Integration - **COMPLETED** for audit-correlator-go
- **Next**: Replicate pattern across remaining Go services
- **Foundation**: Ready for Core Services Phase (TSE-0001 next milestones)

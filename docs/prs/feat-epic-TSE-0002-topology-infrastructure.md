# feat(epic-TSE-0002): Implement Topology Infrastructure

## Summary

Implements **Milestone TSE-0002.4: Topology Infrastructure** - infrastructure adapters that implement the ports defined in TSE-0002.3. This milestone delivers thread-safe in-memory implementations suitable for development, testing, and single-instance deployments.

This work enables the audit-correlator to store and stream topology data by providing concrete implementations of repository and collector ports, completing the infrastructure layer of the Clean Architecture stack.

## What Changed

### Infrastructure Adapters (`internal/infrastructure/topology/`)

- **`memory_topology_repository.go`** - In-memory topology persistence:
  - Thread-safe with RWMutex for concurrent access
  - CRUD operations for nodes and connections
  - Topology snapshot save/restore with version tracking
  - Filtered queries using domain filters
  - Implements `ports.TopologyRepository` interface

- **`memory_metadata_repository.go`** - In-memory metadata storage:
  - Thread-safe node and edge metadata persistence
  - Batch retrieval operations (GetNodesMetadata, GetEdgesMetadata)
  - Implements `ports.MetadataRepository` interface

- **`channel_change_publisher.go`** - Channel-based change streaming:
  - Go channels for real-time topology change distribution
  - Event history (last 1000 events) for catch-up from snapshot IDs
  - Filter-based event matching for selective subscriptions
  - Buffered channels (100 events) for non-blocking publish
  - Implements `ports.TopologyChangePublisher` interface

- **`mock_metrics_collector.go`** - Sample metrics generator:
  - Realistic node metrics (uptime, health score, request rate, latency, CPU, memory)
  - Realistic edge metrics (throughput, error rate, latency percentiles)
  - Streaming metrics with configurable intervals
  - Random data generation for development/testing
  - Implements `ports.MetricsCollector` interface

### Test Coverage

- **`memory_topology_repository_test.go`** - 5 comprehensive tests:
  - Node operations (save, get, delete)
  - Connection operations (save, get, delete)
  - Topology snapshot save/restore
  - Filtered queries by service type
  - Concurrent access safety (10 goroutines)

## Testing

```bash
# Run infrastructure tests
go test -v ./internal/infrastructure/topology/ -count=1

# Results: 5 tests passed
# - TestMemoryTopologyRepository_NodeOperations
# - TestMemoryTopologyRepository_ConnectionOperations
# - TestMemoryTopologyRepository_TopologySnapshot
# - TestMemoryTopologyRepository_FilteredQueries
# - TestMemoryTopologyRepository_ConcurrentAccess

# Build verification
go build ./...

# Full test suite
go test ./... -short -count=1
# Results: All layers pass (domain + application + infrastructure)
```

**Test Coverage**: Infrastructure adapters tested with domain entities, concurrent access verified

## Architecture Validation

✅ **Port Implementation**
- All 4 ports from TSE-0002.3 implemented
- Clean separation between interface and implementation
- Infrastructure depends on domain (entities, ports)
- No circular dependencies

✅ **Thread Safety**
- RWMutex for concurrent read/write access
- Tested with 10 concurrent goroutines
- No data races detected

✅ **In-Memory Design Benefits**
- Zero external dependencies (no database, no Redis)
- Fast startup for development
- Perfect for testing
- Suitable for single-instance deployments
- Easy to swap with persistent implementations later

## Implementation Details

### Memory Topology Repository
- **Storage**: Go maps for O(1) lookups
- **Concurrency**: RWMutex allows multiple readers, single writer
- **Filtering**: Leverages domain `TopologyFilters` for consistency
- **Snapshots**: Full copy semantics for isolation

### Channel Change Publisher
- **Architecture**: Fan-out pattern (one publisher → many subscribers)
- **Catch-up**: Stores last 1000 events for new subscribers from snapshot IDs
- **Non-blocking**: Buffered channels prevent publisher blocking on slow subscribers
- **Filtering**: Server-side filtering reduces network traffic

### Mock Metrics Collector
- **Generation**: Pseudo-random but realistic ranges
- **Streaming**: Ticker-based periodic updates
- **Cancellation**: Context-aware for clean shutdown

## Epic Context

**Epic**: TSE-0002 - Network Topology Visualization

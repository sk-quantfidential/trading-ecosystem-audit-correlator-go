## üîÑ Next Steps: Audit Data Adapter Integration

### TSE-0001.4 Integration Tasks (Phase-by-Phase Implementation)

#### ‚úÖ **Task 0: Test Infrastructure Foundation** - COMPLETED
- [x] Fixed JSON serialization issues (map[string]interface{} ‚Üí json.RawMessage)
- [x] Created comprehensive Makefile with unit/integration test targets
- [x] Established TDD Red-Green-Refactor pattern testing (4 test files, 15+ test scenarios)
- [x] Build status: ‚úÖ Compiles successfully after JSON serialization fix
- [x] Test status: 10 unit tests (7 passing, 3 skipped), 5 integration tests (0 passing, 5 skipped - infrastructure dependencies)

#### ‚úÖ **Task 1: Remove Direct Database Dependencies** - COMPLETED
**Goal**: Eliminate direct database imports and prepare for DataAdapter integration
**Files Modified**:
- `go.mod` - Redis/PostgreSQL dependencies kept as indirect via audit-data-adapter-go
- `internal/infrastructure/service_discovery.go` - No direct Redis imports (uses DataAdapter)
- `internal/services/audit.go` - Uses audit-data-adapter-go models

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [x] No direct Redis client imports in any Go files
- [x] No direct PostgreSQL imports in any Go files (indirect via adapter)
- [x] Code compiles successfully
- [x] All database access points using DataAdapter integration

#### ‚úÖ **Task 2: Refactor Infrastructure Layer** - COMPLETED
**Goal**: Replace direct database access with audit-data-adapter-go DataAdapter interfaces
**Files Modified**:
- `internal/infrastructure/service_discovery.go` ‚Üí Uses `DataAdapter.ServiceDiscoveryRepository` ‚úÖ
- `internal/infrastructure/configuration_client.go` ‚Üí Uses `DataAdapter.CacheRepository` ‚úÖ
- `internal/config/config.go` ‚Üí DataAdapter initialization with `InitializeDataAdapter()` ‚úÖ
- `cmd/server/main.go` ‚Üí Proper lifecycle management (Connect/Disconnect) ‚úÖ

**Implementation Completed**:
1. ‚úÖ DataAdapter initialization in config with environment fallback
2. ‚úÖ Service discovery using ServiceDiscoveryRepository interface
3. ‚úÖ Configuration caching using CacheRepository interface (Set/Get/DeleteByPattern/GetKeysByPattern)
4. ‚úÖ Connection lifecycle management in main.go with proper cleanup

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [x] Service discovery uses only DataAdapter.ServiceDiscoveryRepository interface
- [x] Configuration caching uses only DataAdapter.CacheRepository interface

### üìã **Testing Commands During Integration**:
```bash
# After each task, validate progress
make test-unit              # Should improve pass rate as dependencies are resolved
make test-integration       # Should enable orchestrator connectivity
make status                 # Check overall integration health
make build                  # Ensure compilation throughout process
```

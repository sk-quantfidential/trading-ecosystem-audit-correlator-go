### üèóÔ∏è Milestone TSE-0001.1a: Go Services Bootstrapping
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Priority**: High

**Tasks**:
- [x] Create Go service directory structure following clean architecture
- [x] Implement health check endpoint (REST and gRPC)
- [x] Basic structured logging with levels
- [x] Error handling infrastructure
- [x] Dockerfile for service containerization
- [x] Load component-specific .claude configuration

**BDD Acceptance**: All Go services can start, respond to health checks, and shutdown gracefully

### üîó Milestone TSE-0001.3b: Go Services gRPC Integration
**Status**: Not Started
**Priority**: High

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Implement gRPC server with health service
- [ ] Service registration with Redis-based discovery
- [ ] Configuration service client integration
- [ ] Inter-service communication testing

**BDD Acceptance**: Go services can discover and communicate with each other via gRPC

**Dependencies**: TSE-0001.1a (Go Services Bootstrapping), TSE-0001.3a (Core Infrastructure)

### üîç Milestone TSE-0001.10: Audit Infrastructure (PRIMARY)
**Status**: Not Started
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Enables system validation and correlation

**Tasks**:
- [ ] OpenTelemetry trace collection from all services
- [ ] Basic event correlation (timeline reconstruction)
- [ ] Prometheus metrics aggregation
- [ ] Simple causation analysis (scenario event ‚Üí system response)
- [ ] Event storage and indexing
- [ ] Timeline analysis engine
- [ ] Correlation reporting
- [ ] Validation assertion framework

**BDD Acceptance**: Can correlate a chaos event with subsequent service behavior

**Dependencies**: TSE-0001.3b (Go Services gRPC Integration), TSE-0001.9 (Test Coordination Framework)

### üìà Milestone TSE-0001.12c: Audit Integration
**Status**: Not Started
**Priority**: Medium

**Tasks**:
- [ ] All services emit telemetry to audit correlator
- [ ] Timeline reconstruction across all services
- [ ] Event correlation validation
- [ ] Audit trail generation and reporting

**BDD Acceptance**: Audit correlator successfully tracks and correlates events across all system components

**Dependencies**: TSE-0001.10 (Audit Infrastructure), TSE-0001.12b (Trading Flow Integration)

## Implementation Notes

- **Data Ingestion**: Collect from ALL system signals including risk monitor outputs
- **Event Correlation**: Link scenario injection ‚Üí market changes ‚Üí risk alerts
- **Timeline Analysis**: Complete causal chain reconstruction with timing
- **Independent Validation**: Objective validation of risk monitor effectiveness
- **Coverage Tracking**: Ensure all risk scenarios are tested and validated
- **Performance**: Real-time correlation analysis for large event volumes
